# Note the only differences between release and canary-release jobs are:
# - only canary passes --overwrite flag
# - the VERSION make variable passed to 'make dist checksum' is expected to
#   be "canary" if the job is triggered by a push to "main" branch. If the
#   job is triggered by a tag push, VERSION should be the tag ref.
